# treehouse_u5_introduction_to_git
I am maintaining this as a way to show my work through github as team treehouse uses an internal monitor for progress instead of commits.

I have been doing this for all Treehouse tutorials, practice sessions and code challenges thus far. In general, I have been using "git add ." to make sure I'm adding all files in a directory for staging, then committing, then pushing the directory to github via my shell instead of the github desktop client.
