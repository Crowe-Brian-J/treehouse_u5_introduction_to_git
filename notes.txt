Removing files from git

- rm tin.html doesn't remove tin.html from repository
- use git rm to do so
-- git rm will also do the work of just rm

Moving files in git

- works like mv command
- git mv silver.txt silver.html
-- this works to rename files within repository without having to redo everything
