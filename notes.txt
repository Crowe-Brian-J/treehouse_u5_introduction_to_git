*** Removing files from git

- rm tin.html doesn't remove tin.html from repository
- use git rm to do so
-- git rm will also do the work of just rm

*** Moving files in git

- works like mv command
- git mv silver.txt silver.html
-- this works to rename files within repository without having to redo everything

*** Unstaging Changes

- *Before* committing
-- use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage
--- git reset HEAD medals.html
-- will show when running git status

*** Discarding File Modifications

- *Before* committing
- don't use for single line changes (too small)
- git status
- (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
-- git checkout -- medals.html (no output returned)
- rewinds file to last committed state
-- will show when running git status

*** Undoing File Deletions

- Same as discarding modifications -- Why is this separate?

*** Reverting to Previous Commits

- git log returns list starting with newest commits, followed by their commit checksum (SHA - secure hash algorithm)
-- use q key to get output
- git revert <partial SHA>... (allows you to not have to type the whole thing)
-- git revert c02bf
- git revert HEAD (most recent commit)

*** Cloning a Repository

- git clone <source directory> <local directory>

*** Pulling Changes

- git pull <*optional* default: origin>

*** Adding Remotes

- git remote add <name of directory> <path to remote repository *local or url*>
-- no output if successful

- remote repository must:
-- stage changes
-- commit changes

- local repository
-- git pull <name of directory> <branch>
--- git branch *gets current branch*

*** Pushing Commits to GitHub

- Outside of GitHub, BitBucket & GitLab

- create repository in command line
  - or -
- add github repository as remote
-- git remote add <*origin* (default directory)> <url of github repository (copied from github)>

- git push <*-u* (set upstream option - first time or when changing)> <*origin* (default directory)> <*master* (default branch)>

-- Unless user has setup github secure token, will be prompted for username and password
--- Setup First! (Has been on my computer since 2023)
