*** Removing files from git

- rm tin.html doesn't remove tin.html from repository
- use git rm to do so
-- git rm will also do the work of just rm

*** Moving files in git

- works like mv command
- git mv silver.txt silver.html
-- this works to rename files within repository without having to redo everything

*** Unstaging Changes

- *Before* committing
-- use "git reset HEAD <file>..." to unstage
--- git reset HEAD medals.html
-- will show when running git status

*** Discarding File Modifications

- *Before* committing
- don't use for single line changes (too small)
- git status
- (use "git checkout -- <file>..." to discard changes in working directory)
-- git checkout -- medals.html (no output returned)
- rewinds file to last committed state
-- will show when running git status

*** Undoing File Deletions

- Same as discarding modifications -- Why is this separate?
